# Code Training

This repo aims to be a storage for code trainings. Quizzes come from different sources like:

 - HackerRank, InterviewBit or GeeksforGeeks
 - University
 - Interviews
 
 ## Project Structure
 
 Project is structured in function of the type of the quiz: Algorithm, Data Structures and Concurrent among others.
