# Code Training

This repo aims to be a storage for code trainings. Quizzes come from different sources like:

 - HackerRank, InterviewBit or GeeksforGeeks
 - University
 - Interviews
 
 ## Project Structure
 
 Project is structured in function of the type of the quiz: Algorithm, Data Structures and Concurrent among others.
 
 ## Concurrent
 
 Different quizzes about concurrency:
  - basic: Basic concurrent concepts like: Threads, Runnable, Executors, Futures, Callables and Schedulers  
  - cigarrete: [University quiz](http://enacademic.com/dic.nsf/enwiki/1409197) that aims to roll cigarretes in 
  a concurrency environment where an agent provide material to smokers. **Note** that it is currently be developing.
  - sleeping barber: [Academic problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeping_barber_problem) to be implemented 
  in a future near.
