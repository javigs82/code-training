# Code Training

This repo aims to be a storage for code trainings. Quizzes come from different sources like:

 - HackerRank 
 - University
 - Interviews
 
 ## Project Structure
 
 Project is structured in function of the type of the quiz. Currently there are String & Concurrent trainings, 
 but this is intended to be growing with other kind of quizzes like search, sort, arrays among others.
 
 ## Concurrent
 
 Different quizzes about concurrency:
  - basic: Basic concurrent concepts like: Threads, Runnable, Executors, Futures, Callables and Schedulers

  a concurrency environment where an agent provide material to smokers. **Note** that it is currently be developing.
  - sleeping barber: [Academic problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeping_barber_problem) to be implemented 
  in a future near.
 

### String

Different algorithms about String: 

 - HighestValuePalindrome.java: [HackerRank Exercise](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/richie-rich/problem)
 - ReduceString: [HackerRank Exercise] (https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/string-reduction/problem)
