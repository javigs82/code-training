# Java Code Training

This repo aims to be a storage for code trainings. Quizzes come from different sources like:

 - HackerRank, InterviewBit or GeeksforGeeks
 - University
 - Interviews
 
 ## Project Structure
 
 Project is structured in function of the type of the quiz: Algorithm, Data Structures and Concurrent among others.
 
 ### Algorithm 
  
  Different common algorithm:
  
  - Insertion Sort: [GeeksforGeeks Exercise](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/insertion-sort/)
  - Custom Sort: Sort a map by number of occurrences and by natural order for same frequency.
 
 ### Concurrent
 
 Different quizzes about concurrency:
 
  - basic: Basic concurrent concepts like: Threads, Runnable, Executors, Futures, Callables and Schedulers  
  - cigarrete: [University quiz](http://enacademic.com/dic.nsf/enwiki/1409197) that aims to roll cigarretes in 
  a concurrency environment where an agent provide material to smokers. **Note** that it is currently be developing.
